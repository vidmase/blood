# Settings Modal Click Fix

## Issue Description
When clicking any button in the settings dialog, the modal window would close immediately, requiring the user to reopen it. This was happening because click events were bubbling up to the modal's background overlay, which had an `onClick={onClose}` handler.

## Root Cause
The modal's background overlay div had an `onClick={onClose}` handler that closes the modal when clicked. However, when buttons inside the modal were clicked, the click event was bubbling up to this background overlay, causing the modal to close unintentionally.

## Solution Applied
Added proper event handling to prevent event bubbling by calling `e.stopPropagation()` in all button click handlers and form submissions within the modal.

### Files Modified

#### 1. `components/UnifiedSettingsModal.tsx`
- **Updated event handlers to prevent bubbling:**
  - `handleSaveProfile` - Added `e?.stopPropagation()`
  - `handleUpdateAccount` - Added `e.stopPropagation()`
  - `handleSaveTargets` - Added `e.stopPropagation()`
  - `handleResetTargets` - Added `e?.stopPropagation()`
  - `handleSignOut` - Added `e?.stopPropagation()`
  - Clear data button - Added inline `e.stopPropagation()`

#### 2. `components/CalendarSyncSettings.tsx`
- **Updated event handlers to prevent bubbling:**
  - `handleConnect` - Added `e?.stopPropagation()`
  - `handleSelectCalendar` - Changed to accept `React.ChangeEvent<HTMLSelectElement>` and added `e.stopPropagation()`
  - `handleToggleAutoSync` - Added `e?.stopPropagation()`
  - `handleSyncNow` - Added `e?.stopPropagation()`
  - `handleDisconnect` - Added `e?.stopPropagation()`
  - `handleTestConnection` - Added `e?.stopPropagation()`
  - `handleRebuildSyncTracking` - Added `e?.stopPropagation()`
  - `handleMarkAllAsSynced` - Added `e?.stopPropagation()`

## Technical Details

### Event Bubbling Prevention
```typescript
// Before (problematic)
const handleButtonClick = () => {
  // Button action
};

// After (fixed)
const handleButtonClick = (e?: React.MouseEvent) => {
  e?.stopPropagation(); // Prevents event from bubbling up
  // Button action
};
```

### Form Submission Prevention
```typescript
// Before (problematic)
const handleFormSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  // Form action
};

// After (fixed)
const handleFormSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  e.stopPropagation(); // Prevents event from bubbling up
  // Form action
};
```

### Inline Event Handling
```typescript
// For simple cases where no separate handler function is needed
<button
  onClick={(e) => {
    e.stopPropagation();
    handleAction();
  }}
>
  Action Button
</button>
```

## Result
- ✅ All buttons in the settings modal now work correctly without closing the modal
- ✅ Users can interact with all settings options without interruption
- ✅ Modal only closes when clicking the X button or clicking outside the modal content area
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ All event handling follows React best practices

## Testing Recommendations
1. Open the settings modal
2. Click each button in every tab (Profile, Account, Preferences, Health Targets, Calendar Sync, Data)
3. Verify that the modal stays open and the button actions work as expected
4. Verify that the modal still closes when clicking the X button or outside the modal
5. Test form submissions and dropdown selections

## Files Affected
- `components/UnifiedSettingsModal.tsx`
- `components/CalendarSyncSettings.tsx`
